A volcano at Hunga Tonga–Hunga Haʻapai erupted on January 15, 2022.

The plume went as high as [36 miles.](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/149474/tonga-volcano-plume-reached-the-mesosphere) The resulting shockwave went around the world.

The islands of Hunga Tonga and Hunga Haʻapai were joined by an eruption in December 2014. Not much remained of the volcano or islands after the eruption on January 15, 2022. See the comparison of both Landsat and Maxar imagery below.

### Nuclear Blast Comparison

At its peak the eruption was ~650 km in diameter. I made a comparison showing the scale of the eruption compared to the thermal radation radius of various nuclear blasts, data from the [Nukemap](https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/)
